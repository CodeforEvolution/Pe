Pe has now been released as open source under a BSD style license.

To build Pe you theoretically only need to execute make in the base directory of the pe distribution. To flip between debug and non-debug builds you can change the value of the DEBUG variable in the Makefile.

I've tried to gather all code for the 2.2.3d release, however I'm not sure everything made it since I forgot to tag that release in cvs. The code is quite old and may contain bugs here and there. This version of Pe does not contain any changes I made since the 2.2.3d release. Development of Pe stopped after this release and I went on to develop Pepper which is available as commercial software for MacOS, Win2k and soon X11.

If you make changes to this source code I would appreciate it very much if you could send those changes to me. There is no obligation to do so however.
